/*
 * @brief Macro behavior for momentary layer switching with feedback.
 *
 * This macro creates a complex `zmk,behavior-macro` node designed for momentary layer
 * activation (`&mo`) coupled with dynamic layer status indication.
 *
 * - When the key associated with this macro is pressed, it momentarily switches to the `MO` layer.
 * Simultaneously, it sends a unique key press (a keycode above F13, specifically `F_MO`)
 * to signal the activation of the `MO` layer.
 * - Upon release of the key, the macro exits the momentary `MO` layer and sends a different
 * unique key press (another keycode above F13, `F_TO`). This second keycode indicates
 * the return to the previous layer, or a transition to the `TO` layer, providing
 * continuous feedback on the active layer state.
 *
 * The `wait-ms` and `tap-ms` properties (using `MC_LAYERS`) suggest a timing mechanism
 * to ensure proper sequencing of actions within the macro, particularly useful for
 * ensuring the layer change is registered before the subsequent key press, and that
 * the release action correctly processes.
 *
 * @param MO Momentary Layer: The identifier for the layer to momentarily activate when the key is pressed.
 * This is also used to derive the initial function key (`F_MO`).
 * @param TO Target Layer: The identifier for the layer to return to (or transition to)
 * when the key is released. This is used to derive the final
